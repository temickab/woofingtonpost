## Synopsis

The application I created is called Woofington Post. The purpose of this app was to create a humor based news site.

## What is used

* I used express-handlebars as a view engine
* Implemented BootStrap classes for design
* Created several handlebars template files for the design
* Used full Crud Functionalty for implementation 

The one thing that I'm proud of is fully understanding how to use the middleware handlebars. I was extremley confused about how it works and with patience and asking questions, I was able to fully implement handlebars to my project.

The one thing I would do differently next time is to start with having FULL CRUD functionality first and then work on everything else. Also using Post-Man to test it.

The next feature I would like to implement is to add user authentication using the passport.js.


## My Motivation

What motivated me to create this app was just plain humor and cuteness. I love dogs, and love to laugh so I decided to create an app with both of the things I love.
